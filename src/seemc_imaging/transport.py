"""
transport.py -- Monte Carlo simulation of secondary electron emission.

This is the planar reference transport kernel for the standalone
``seemc-imaging`` package.  It was forked from the validated optlib SEEMC
implementation before scene geometry was introduced.  It reads the same
material-database format and transports electrons through a semi-infinite
solid using the analytic :class:`~seemc_imaging.geometry.Plane` backend.  The
default plane retains the validated convention: solid at z > 0 and vacuum at
z < 0.

=============================================================================
ENERGY CONVENTIONS  --  READ THIS BEFORE TOUCHING ANY TABLE LOOKUP
=============================================================================
Three different energy references appear in this code.  Mixing them up is the
single easiest way to get a wrong answer, so every table lookup goes through a
named converter in `Sample` and never touches `material_data` directly.

    E_s     "solid" energy, measured from the BOTTOM OF THE VALENCE BAND.
            This is the state variable carried by `Electron.energy` while the
            electron is inside the solid.  It equals T' in Shinotsuka et al.,
            Surf. Interface Anal. 47 (2015) 871, Eq. (2).

    T       = E_s - E_F, measured from the FERMI LEVEL.  This is the abscissa
            of the standard IMFP tables (Shinotsuka Table 2: "electron kinetic
            energy T with respect to the Fermi level").

    E_vac   = E_s - U_i  with  U_i = E_F + phi,  the kinetic energy the
            electron would have in vacuum.  Used for emission, NOT for table
            lookups.

    NOTE ON THE ELASTIC TABLES.  It is tempting to assume ELSEPA is fed a
    vacuum kinetic energy.  For the solid-state (muffin-tin) optical model it
    is not.  Salvat/Jablonski/Powell, "elsepa ... (version 2020)", Eqs. (7)-(8):
    outside the muffin-tin sphere the potential is the constant
    V(r) = -Delta_E - i*Gamma, "the background potential of the projectile
    within the solid", and the phase shifts are obtained from
    V1(r) = V(r) + Delta_E + i*Gamma, WHICH VANISHES FOR r > Rmt.  Because V1
    vanishes in the interstitial region, the asymptotic momentum corresponds
    to the input energy EV directly: EV is the kinetic energy INSIDE the solid,
    measured from the muffin-tin zero.  For a metal the muffin-tin zero is
    essentially the band bottom and Delta_E is the inner potential, so

            EV  ~=  E_s        (VB-bottom referenced, NOT vacuum)

    Hence emfp_energy_ref defaults to 'vb_bottom'.  Getting this wrong shifts
    the elastic lookup by U_i (13.4 eV for Cu) into the region where the cross
    section is rising steeply, which collapses the low-energy elastic MFP and
    with it the secondary-electron escape depth.

Which reference each DB table uses is declared once, in `MCConfig`:

    imfp_energy_ref  : 'vb_bottom' (default, matches the optlib FPA builder)
                       or 'fermi'  (matches the published Shinotsuka tables)
    emfp_energy_ref  : 'vb_bottom' (default, corrected solid-state ELSEPA
                       convention described above)
                       or 'vacuum' (legacy comparison only)

KINEMATIC INVARIANTS (Shinotsuka Eq. 2-3) -- these are asserted, not assumed:

    omega_max = T' - E_F = E_s - E_F        (maximum energy loss)
    q_bounds  are evaluated at T' = E_s     (NOT at E_s - E_F)

The relativistic momenta used for the q-bounds are also used for the
projectile deflection, so the sampled q is guaranteed to lie in
[|k - k'|, k + k'] and the law-of-cosines never needs clamping.

=============================================================================
CHANGELOG vs. the previous version
=============================================================================
Physics / correctness
  1. A truncated step at the surface no longer forces a scattering event.
     Previously every internal reflection was followed by a collision that the
     exponential never generated, piling up spurious energy loss in exactly
     the depth range that controls SEY.
  2. Secondary-electron direction is now built from the momentum transfer q
     (rotated out of the frame with z || q) instead of the ad-hoc rule
     [pi - theta, phi + pi] applied to the *already deflected* projectile
     direction.  Energy and momentum of the (projectile, SE) pair are now
     consistent by construction.
  3. `energy_se` can no longer leak from a previous collision: `scatter()`
     returns an explicit result object instead of mutating shared state.
  4. Rejected inelastic samples no longer silently become null collisions.
     omega is drawn from a CDF truncated at omega_max, and q from a grid built
     inside [q-, q+], so a valid event is produced every time.  The residual
     failure modes are counted in `diagnostics`.
  5. q-bounds evaluated at E_s (was E_s - E_F).  See above.
  6. Projectile deflection uses relativistic momenta, consistent with the
     q-bounds.
  7. The incident beam is refracted at the surface barrier (parallel momentum
     conserved), instead of keeping its vacuum direction.
  8. Energy-bin lookup is stochastically interpolated between adjacent bins
     instead of snapping to the nearest bin.
  9. Unconditional death check at the top of the transport loop plus a step
     counter, so a sub-barrier electron in a non-metal cannot loop forever.
 10. Contradictory q-unit handling removed: the DB's 'q' grid has one declared
     unit (`MCConfig.q_unit`), validated at load time.

Bookkeeping
 11. Emitted electrons are classified both by cascade flag and by the
     conventional 50 eV cut, so results are comparable to measured
     delta / eta curves and to MAST-SEY.
 12. Per-energy statistical uncertainties (standard error of the mean).
 13. Emission energy and angle spectra are collected.
 14. One shared trajectory implementation for serial and parallel runs.
 15. Reproducible seeding via numpy SeedSequence (no PID dependence).

    (v) Are the DB's channel-resolved ELFs consistent with the Fermi energy
    the DB reports?

    Mao et al. 2008 Eq. (9) puts single-electron excitation in
    q- <= q <= q+ with q_-+ = -/+ k_F + sqrt(k_F^2 + 2 omega).  That window is
    exactly where the Fermi-sphere disk of Eq. (18) is non-empty, so:

      * elf_se strength at q < q-  ->  losses with NO available target state.
        Under se_channel_rule='table' those become dropped or fallback
        secondaries; they are really plasmon losses that the FPA decomposition
        assigned to the single-particle channel because it integrates over a
        scanning omega_p whose k_F(omega_p) exceeds the material's k_F.
      * elf_pl strength at q > q-  ->  the mirror image.

    This routine measures the actual support of each channel table and inverts
    the boundary to recover the k_F that the tables were built with:

        from the lower edge of elf_se:  k_F = (2 omega - q-^2) / (2 q-)
        from the upper edge of elf_se:  k_F = (q+^2 - 2 omega) / (2 q+)

    A k_F_eff that is consistent across omega but differs from the DB's
    sqrt(2 E_F) tells you exactly which value to put in
    MCConfig.feg_fermi_energy -- or, better, that you should use
    se_channel_rule='mao' and stop relying on the split.
